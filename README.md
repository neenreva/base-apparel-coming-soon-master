## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Spent way longer on this then I should have. I knew the layout switch between web/mobile would lend itself using grid for layout so I took the opportunity to explor css grid. Found that when you've gained layout intuition from using flexbox, grid challenges that quite a bit. Containers are important and simpler concepts like aligning items are not like you'd expect. Still worth the exploration and definitely something I need to practice more. Scaling seems to be my biggest issue here. My guess is that I am not using the grid-template props in the best way. I've picked up that these two  are often used with each other and I now am starting to break down layout with that perspective.
